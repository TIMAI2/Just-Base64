# Just-Base64

Surprisingly, not one of my first ventures into java programming and AI2 extension building, but perhaps one of the simplest.

This extension will take a string and convert it to base64, returning the output.

The extension will also take a base64 (of a string) and convert it to that string, returning the output.
